# Logisim-Computer
This is a computer made from scratch using logisim, circuits, wires, gates and also includes code to use for the computer


# How to Use
- Download Logism: http://www.cburch.com/logisim/

- Once loaded, click on the RSC tab on the left side of Logisim.
- Right click the RAM module (P.S. It has alot of 0's on it) and press "Load Image"
- Load in the desired program's bytecode. (Read the program's normal code for a better understanding of what it does)

- Choose desired Tick Frequency (The faster the better as Logisim and the code takes awhile)
- Click on "Ticks Enabled"
